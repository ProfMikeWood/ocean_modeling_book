# Numerical Ocean Modeling

Welcome to an Introduction to Ocean Modeling!

This resource is a practical resource to introduct the construction, implementation, and analysis of ocean models. Here, we investigate 3D numerical models constructed by solving equations of motion and thermodynamics in a time-stepping scheme. It does not cover other modeling approach such as empirical, statistics, or machine learning techinques. The primary tool used in this book is the MIT General Circulation model - a versitile, open-sourced framework used widely in oceanography.

This book designed for people new to ocean modeling although it will hopefully also serve as a convenient reference for those who have been at it for a while. People with an introductory background in coding, some knowledge of calculus, and an understanding of Earth science topics will be most suited to leverage these resources.

The book is organized into four main sections
1. Getting Started - instructions for install tools used through this book
2. Oceanography - a short background in various oceanographic topics
3. The MITgcm - instructions for constructing and running models
4. Analysis - introduction to some strategies for assessing model output

None of these sections is intended to be exhaustive - rather, the aim is to generate a practical introduction to the toic. Additional references are provided at the end of each section.
