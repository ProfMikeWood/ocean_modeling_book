# Numerical Ocean Modeling

Welcome to an Introduction to Ocean Modeling!

This resource is designed to be a practical guide to introduce the construction, implementation, and analysis of ocean models. Here, we investigate 3D numerical models constructed by solving equations of motion and thermodynamics in a time-stepping scheme. The primary tool used in this book is the [MIT General Circulation model](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm) - a versitile, open-sourced framework used widely in oceanography.

```{note}
This book is currently being written for a CS 185C Special Topics Course at San José State University. It is a work in progress and will continue to be updated through Spring 2025. If you have any feedback or constructive suggestions, feel free to submit an issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/ProfMikeWood/ocean_modeling_book) for this book.

This book is for people new to ocean modeling although it will hopefully also serve as a convenient reference for those who have been at it for a while. People with an introductory background in coding, some knowledge of calculus, and an understanding of Earth science topics will be most suited to leverage these resources.

The book is organized into six main sections:
1. Getting Started - instructions for installing tools used throughout this book
2. Oceanography - a short background in various oceanographic topics
3. Numerical Modeling - introduction to some aspects of ocean modeling
4. The MITgcm - instructions for constructing and running models using MIT General Circulation Model
5. Computing Clusters - instructions for running models on a computing cluster
6. Analysis - introduction to some strategies for assessing model output

None of these sections is intended to be exhaustive - rather, the aim is to generate a practical introduction to the topic. Additional references are provided at the end of each section.
