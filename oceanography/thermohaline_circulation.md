# Thermohaline Circulation

In addition to wind, the other major factor controlling global ocean circulation is density, a function of temperature and salinity in the ocean. This page provides a brief overview of thermohaline circulation - water movements modulated by variations in ocean temperature and salinity.

## Temperature and Salinity in the Global Ocean
The following plot shows a snapshot of temperature from the ECCO Version 4 State Estimate:

Similar to the previous plot, we can also examine salinity:
