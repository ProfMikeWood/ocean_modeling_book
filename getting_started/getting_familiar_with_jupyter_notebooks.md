# Getting Familiar with Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks were designed as a convenient way to store both text and code together in the same place. Jupyter notebooks were designed primarily with the coding languages **Ju*lia, **Pyt**hon, and *R* in mind although there are some plugins for other languages as well.

## Opening a Jupyter Notebook
A straight-forward way to open a Jupyter notebook is through the terminal. If you are using a Mac, you can open the default Terminal application. If you are on a Windows machine, then you can launch the Anaconda Prompt, found under the Start menu.

When you open the terminal, activate a conda environment with jupyter installed. If you followed the Installing Python and Jupyter instructions, your `cs185c` environment will be set up correctly. Activate it in the terminal:
```
conda activate cs185c
```

Now, you can launch your Jupyter notebook with the simple command:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Note that your notebook will open in your default web browser. Note that Jupyter leverages the web brower interface but it is not online.

With Jupyter open, you can navigate through your file system, open existing notebooks, and create new ones using the option in the upper right hand side of the screen.

## Jupyter Notebook Basics
There are two key components for a Jupyter notebook - the kernel and the notebook cells. These are described in the next two sections.

### The Jupyter Kernel
The kernel of a notebook is running in the background of a notebook.
