    "# Getting Familiar with Unix Environments\n",
    "This page is designed to provide an introduction to Unix-type shell commands. On MacOS, the standard Terminal is `zsh` (as of 2019) which is a Unix-type shell. On Windows, the [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) project provides a Unix-like environment that uses the same commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Commands\n",
    "The commands introduced in this page are summarized in the following table for convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Description | Commonly-Used Options | \n",
    "|--------|----------|--------|\n",
    "| pwd | Obtains the present working directory | |\n",
    "| ls | Lists the contents of the present working directory | -l (verbose); -a (show hidden)|\n",
    "| cd | Changes directory to a different location | |\n",
    "| cp | Copies files from one location to another | -r (recursively copy from directories)|\n",
    "| ln | Links one file to another | -s (symbolic)|\n",
    "| cat | Print contents of a file to the terminal | |\n",
    "| head | Print contents of the start of a file | -n (number of lines)|\n",
    "| tail | Print contents of the end of a file | -n (number of lines)|\n",
    "| mkdir | Make a directory |  |\n",
    "| rm | Removes file(s) from the system | -r (recursively remove from directories)|\n",
    "| rmdir | Remove directory | -R (remove a directory and all of the files inside of it) |\n",

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "To get started with this introductory tutorial, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. Download the [model_config_example.zip](https://github.com/ProfMikeWood/ocean_modeling_book/blob/main/getting_started/model_config_example.zip) example file set from the Github repository for this book and unzip it.\n",
    "2. Open the Unix shell you use on your machine.\n",

    "The `model_config_example` directory contains several subdirectories containing various files in the following format:\n",

    "#### Determining your path\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pwd\n",
