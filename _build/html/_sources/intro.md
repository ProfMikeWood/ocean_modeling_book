# Numerical Ocean Modeling

Welcome to Introduction to Ocean Modeling!

This books designed for people new to ocean modeling although it will hopefully serve as a convenient reference for those who have been at it for a while. People with an introductory background in coding, some knowledge of calculus, and an understanding of Earth science topics will be most suited to leverage these resources.

The book is organized into four main sections
1. Getting Started
2. Oceanography
3. The MITgcm
4. Analysis
None of these sections is intended to be exhaustive - rather, the aim is to generate a practical introduction to the toic. Additional references are provided at the end of each section.
