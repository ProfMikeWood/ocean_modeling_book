    "Density ($\\rho$) is a key parameter in determining fluid flow in the ocean. For example, it plays a role in the pressure gradient force:\n",

    "Density itself is a function of temperature, salinity, and pressure: $\\rho = f(T,S,p)$. This relationship, called the **equation of state** has been drived by measuring the density of seawater in a laboratory setting across a wide range of temperature, salinity, and pressure values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given its fundamental role relating key ocean properties, the equation of state is used often oceanography and has been implemented in toolboxes in various languages. In Python, we can access this relationship using the Gibbs Seawater Toolbox (gsw) and use it to examine density in temperature and salinity space:"
