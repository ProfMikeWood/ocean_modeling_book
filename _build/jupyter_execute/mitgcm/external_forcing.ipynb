    "# External Forcing\n",
    "External forcing fields (usually) refer to atmospheric parameters that modify the temperature, salinity, or momentum in the upper ocean. However, there are some occasionally-used external forcing fields that are implemented at the ocean floor, such as geothermal heat flux. The following table lists commonly-used external forcing fields:\n",
